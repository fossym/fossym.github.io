Project Compass: A New Handbook for Scouting
What we know by heart cannot be taken from us. - George Steiner

# Mission
Scouting is one of the most successful non-formal educational movements in history, shaping millions of lives through an emphasis on practical skills, community, leadership, and ethical living.  But how does it work? Why does it work? And how can we make it work better in a rapidly changing world? 

We believe that by articulating the "why" behind the "what," we can help improve the Movement, inspire new approaches to the Youth Program, and position Scouting as a serious subject of intellectual inquiry.

# What We're Exploring
Contributions that tackle, but are not limited to, the following themes:

## The Philosophy of Scouting
- What are the deep ethical and philosophical underpinnings of the Movement? Let's move beyond rote memorization of the Scout Law and ask bigger questions.

- The Scout Law as a Framework for Ethical Living: How do the points of the Scout Law reflect different ethical traditions? How is this "work in progress" negotiated by young people today? 

- Meaning-Making in the Outdoors: What is the relationship between challenge, suffering, meaningful difficulties, inspiration, and the construction of personal meaning? 

- "Glocal" Citizenship: How does Scouting’s blend of local community service and global brotherhood (as described by academics like Edward Vallory) provide a unique model for modern citizenship? 

## Scouting Through the Lens of Cognitive Science
Scouting is a rich, real-world laboratory for understanding how people learn, think, and work together.

- The Patrol as a Distributed Cognitive System: How does a Scout patrol solve problems (like navigation or building a camp kitchen) by distributing cognitive tasks across people, tools (maps, compasses), and the environment itself? We can analyze this using frameworks like 4E/6E Cognition (Embodied, Embedded, Extended, Enacted; and Emotional, Evolving).

- The Badge System and  Motivation: The Personal Progressive Scheme is a powerful motivational tool. How does it leverage curiosity by creating "information gaps"? How does it balance the goal-selection (choosing a badge) and goal-engaged (earning the badge) states described in motivational psychology? 

- Scouting as an Entropy-Reducing Cultural Ecosystem: The routines, traditions, and shared knowledge of Scouting create a predictable, low-entropy environment. How does this stable cultural "niche" make it easier for young people's predictive brains to learn and explore a complex world without being overwhelmed? 

- The 'How' of Scouting: Examining the Method
Let's ground our discussions in the practical realities of Scouting today. What works, what doesn't, and how can we innovate?

- The Youth Programme Lifecycle: The "Guide to Youth Programme in Scouting" (GPS, a publication by WOSM) outlines a process for reviewing and designing programmes. What are the real-world challenges to this? How can we ensure programmes remain relevant?

- Solving Real Problems: What do Scouts actually want? Let's look at feedback from SPL roundtables. How can we design more engaging activities for older Scouts, improve summer camp, or run better camporees? 

- Adult Association and Leadership: How do adults best support a youth-led organization? How do we train and retain volunteers who understand their role as facilitators, not just instructors? 

## Scouting in the World
Scouting doesn't exist in a vacuum. It is shaped by and must respond to major global trends.

- Adapting to a Changing World: How should Scouting respond to trends like the "non-formalisation of formal education," digitalization, and globalization identified in World Scout Education Congresses? 

- Scouting as a Non-State Institution: In a world where some see traditional liberalism as failing to create community (as argued by philosophers like Patrick Deneen), what role can Scouting play? How does the decentralized, self-organizing patrol model reflect Hayek's ideas about distributed knowledge in society?

- Community Involvement and Social Impact: How do we move from simple service projects to meaningful community engagement that creates lasting change? How can we better measure and articulate Scouting's social impact? 

# Contributing
## Who?
You can. We are looking for contributions from:

Scouts (Youth Members): Your direct experiences, ideas, and critiques are the foundation of this project. What's working in your troop? What would you change?

University Students & Young Adults: Whether you're an alum or new to the ideas, apply what you're learning in your courses — be it philosophy, psychology, sociology, or computer science — to Scouting.

Scouters (Adult Volunteers): Your wisdom, observations, and on-the-ground knowledge are invaluable. What have you learned from years of facilitating youth development?

Academics & Researchers: We welcome formal analyses that use Scouting as a case study for broader theories of education, sociology, and human development.

## How?
We welcome submissions in a variety of formats. Find one that fits your style and knowledge.

Personal Essays & Reflections: Share a story about a transformative experience in Scouting and reflect on why it was impactful.

Investigative Articles: Take a concept from a provided reading (or one of your own) and apply it directly to a Scouting practice.

Practical Guides & Proposals: Propose a concrete improvement based on a theoretical insight. (e.g., "Designing a Camporee Challenge to Foster Creativity" ).

Book & Article Reviews: Discuss an academic work, like the National Academies Press' [How People Learn](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24783/how-people-learn-ii-learners-contexts-and-cultures)

Discussion & Peer Review

## Setting up the repo
All one should need is hugo (the static site generator). Hugo is written in Go (and eg. Jekyll is written in Ruby), so the choice was made for easy installation management. No programming is necessary unless a complicated post is desired, like embedding a youtube video. I recommend using an offline/desktop content management system to help write markdown, such as <https://gohugo.io/tools/front-ends/>.

# Guiding Principles

Curiosity Over Certainty. We are here to learn together.

Respectful Dialogue. We are all part of the same global Movement.

Bridge Building: We aim to connect the practical with the theoretical, the youth member with the academic, and different parts of the Movement with each other.

A Constructive Spirit: Our ultimate goal is to improve Scouting. Criticism should be paired with constructive ideas and a genuine desire to help the Movement achieve its mission.

# Getting Started
TODO: Enable comments on individual posts.

TODO: Discussion format. Forum? Discussions through github?

Draft a pitch, an outline, or a full article in your preferred format. Also, making videos and building a community is welcome. Many people are making their scouting resources public, but connections need built.

Let's make the world's leading educational youth movement also one of its most thoughtfully examined.
