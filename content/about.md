Welcome to **Academic Scouting**!

(Why FOSS Scouting? It refers to Free *(libre)* and Open Source ... with an extra S to not be confused with a Scouting America fundraising program...)

I have been fascinated by two seemingly disparate fields: the formal study of the mind (cognitive science) and the hands-on character development of Scouting.

This website is my attempt to bridge that gap. Over the years, I've noticed that many of the methods used in Scouting—the patrol method, skill instruction, outdoor challenges, and leadership development—are powerful, real-world examples and inspirations for research in cognitive science and other fields.

**Our Mission:**
* To analyze Scouting practices through the lens of cognitive science.
* To explain why certain methods are so effective for learning and personal growth.
* To provide a deeper appreciation for the "why" behind the "what" of Scouting.

Concepts like *situated cognition*, *procedural memory*, *distributed cognition*, and *cognitive load theory* aren't just academic terms; they are happening in every patrol meeting, on every hike, and at every campfire.

Whether you're a Scouter, a scientist, a parent, or just curious, I hope you find these explorations insightful.
